# AIC21-track1-team19
## Introduction
### In this repo, we include the submission to AICity Challenge 2021 Vehicle Counts by Class at Multiple Intersections.

Our implementation comprised of:


(1) we re-designed a detection-tracking-counting (DTC) for movement-specific vehicle counting problem
regard to both effectiveness and efficiency.

(2) We modified Deep SORT with the efficient features to improve
the multiple objects tracking performance. 

(3) We proposed
the cosine similarity-based and orbit-based nearest
neighbor analysis to improve the vehicle counting
performance.

## Setup
### For setup clone the repository and install the conda environment:
`
conda env create -f conda-gpu.yml
`
